# Data-Science---Exploratory-Data-Analysis----Project-1

I could not get git, or github to upload my pictures of plots, so here is a dropbox url of all the graphs.

All code is working  and all graphs are correct. 

If you download the datafile for this project into your R directory 
and name it household_power_consumption.txt and run my code, it will generate the graph and save it to your R directory.
